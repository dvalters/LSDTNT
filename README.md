# Template Numerical Toolkit

[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/8b0de458ae8f44a0a62d7fa60fd8c4f9)](https://www.codacy.com/app/dvalters/TNT?utm_source=github.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=dvalters/TNT&amp;utm_campaign=Badge_Grade)

This is a work in progress to tidy up the Template Numerical Toolkit library by fixing formatting issues, removing deprecated features, and modernising it to removing compiler warnings with newer C++ compilers.

The original TNT pages are here: http://math.nist.gov/tnt/

It does not appear that the TNT library is under active development any more. The original code was released into the public domain by the US government. The linked website was last updated 2004.
